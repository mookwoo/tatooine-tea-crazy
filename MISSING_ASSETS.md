# Missing Assets

The following asset file is missing and needs to be added:

## Audio Files

- `assets/lightsaber.mp3` - Lightsaber sound effect for navigation clicks
  - Referenced in scripts.js
  - Should be a short lightsaber activation/hum sound
  - Recommended source: Pixabay or other royalty-free sound libraries
  - Current status: Missing (functionality is implemented but sound won't play)

## How to Add

1. Download a lightsaber sound effect in MP3 format
2. Place it in the `assets/` directory as `lightsaber.mp3`
3. The sound will automatically work with the existing JavaScript code

The sound functionality is fully implemented - clicking any navigation link will attempt to play the sound effect, but it currently fails due to the missing file.
